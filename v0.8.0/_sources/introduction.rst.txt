Introduction
############

The Grammar
-----------

The `grammar <blark/iec.lark>`__ uses Lark’s Earley parser algorithm.

The grammar itself is not perfect. It may not reliably parse your source
code or produce useful Python instances just yet.

See `issues <https://github.com/klauer/blark/issues>`__ for further
details.

As a fun side project, blark isn’t at the top of my priority list. For
an idea of where the project is going, see the issues list.

Requirements
------------

-  `lark <https://github.com/lark-parser/lark>`__ (for grammar-based
   parsing)
-  `lxml <https://github.com/lxml/lxml>`__ (for parsing TwinCAT
   projects)

Capabilities
------------

-  TwinCAT source code file parsing (``*.TcPOU`` and others)
-  TwinCAT project and solution loading
-  ``lark.Tree`` generation of any supported source code
-  Python dataclasses of supported source code, with introspection and
   code refactoring

Works-in-progress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Sphinx API documentation generation (a new Sphinx domain)
-  Code reformatting
-  “Dependency store” - recursively parse and inspect project
   dependencies
-  Summary generation - a layer on top of dataclasses to summarize
   source code details
-  Rewriting source code directly in TwinCAT source code files

Installation
------------

Installation is quick with Pip.

.. code:: bash

   pip install --upgrade blark

Quickstart (pip / virtualenv with venv)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Set up an environment using venv:

.. code:: bash

   $ python -m venv blark_venv
   $ source blark_venv/bin/activate

2. Install the library with pip:

.. code:: bash

   $ python -m pip install blark

Quickstart (Conda)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Set up an environment using conda:

.. code:: bash

   $ conda create -n blark-env -c conda-forge python=3.10 pip blark
   $ conda activate blark-env

2. Install the library from conda:

.. code:: bash

   $ conda install blark

Development install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you run into issues or wish to run an unreleased version of blark,
you may install directly from this repository like so:

.. code:: bash

   $ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/klauer/blark

Sample runs
-----------

Run the parser or experimental formatter utility. Current supported file
types include those from TwinCAT3 projects ( ``.tsproj``, ``.sln``,
``.TcPOU``, ``.TcGVL``) and plain-text ``.st`` files.

.. code:: bash

   $ blark parse --print-tree blark/tests/POUs/F_SetStateParams.TcPOU
   function_declaration
     None
     F_SetStateParams
     indirect_simple_specification
       None
       simple_specification        BOOL
     input_declarations
       None
       var1_init_decl
         var1_list
   ... (clipped) ...

To interact with the Python dataclasses directly, make sure IPython is
installed first and then try:

::

   $ blark parse --interactive blark/tests/POUs/F_SetStateParams.TcPOU
   # Assuming IPython is installed, the following prompt will come up:

   In [1]: results[0].identifier
   Out[1]: 'F_SetStateParams/declaration'

   In [2]: results[1].identifier
   Out[2]: 'F_SetStateParams/implementation'

Dump out a parsed and reformatted set of source code:

.. code:: bash

   $ blark format blark/tests/source/array_of_objects.st
   {attribute 'hide'}
   METHOD prv_Detection : BOOL
       VAR_IN_OUT
           currentChannel : ARRAY [APhase..CPhase] OF class_baseVector(SIZEOF(vector_t), 0);
       END_VAR
   END_METHOD

blark supports rewriting TwinCAT source code files directly as well:

.. code:: bash

   $ blark format blark/tests/POUs/F_SetStateParams.TcPOU

   <TcPlcObject Version="1.1.0.1" ProductVersion="3.1.4024.0">
     <POU Name="F_SetStateParams" Id="{f9611d23-4bb5-422d-9f11-2cc94e61fc9e}" SpecialFunc="None">
       <Declaration><![CDATA[FUNCTION F_SetStateParams : BOOL
       VAR_INPUT
           nStateRef : UDINT;
           rPosition : REAL;
           rTolerance : REAL;
           stBeamParams : ST_BeamParams;

   ... (clipped) ...

It is also possible to parse the source code into a tokenized
``SourceCode`` tree which supports code introspection and rewriting:

.. code:: python

   In [1]: import blark

   In [2]: parsed = blark.parse_source_code(
      ...:     """
      ...: PROGRAM ProgramName
      ...:     VAR_INPUT
      ...:         iValue : INT;
      ...:     END_VAR
      ...:     VAR_ACCESS
      ...:         AccessName : SymbolicVariable : TypeName READ_WRITE;
      ...:     END_VAR
      ...:     iValue := iValue + 1;
      ...: END_PROGRAM
      ...: """
      ...: )

   # Access the lark Tree here:
   In [3]: parsed.tree.data
   Out[3]: Token('RULE', 'iec_source')

   # Or the transformed information:
   In [3]: transformed = parsed.transform()

   In [4]: program = transformed.items[0]

   In [5]: program.declarations[0].items[0].variables[0].name
   Out[5]: Token('IDENTIFIER', 'iValue')

The supported starting grammar rules for the reusable parser include:

::

   "iec_source"
   "action"
   "data_type_declaration"
   "function_block_method_declaration"
   "function_block_property_declaration"
   "function_block_type_declaration"
   "function_declaration"
   "global_var_declarations"
   "program_declaration"
   "statement_list"

Other starting rules remain possible for advanced users, however a new
parser must be created in that scenario and transformations are not
supported.

Additionally, please note that you should avoid creating parsers
on-the-fly as there is a startup cost to re-parsing the grammar. Utilize
the provided parser from ``blark.get_parser()`` whenever possible.

::

   In [1]: import blark

   In [2]: parser = blark.new_parser(start=["any_integer"])

   In [3]: Tree('hex_integer', [Token('HEX_STRING', '1010')])

Adding Test Cases
-----------------

Presently, test cases are provided in two forms. Within the
``blark/tests/`` directory there are ``POUs/`` and ``source/``
directories.

TwinCAT source code files belong in ``blark/tests/POUs``. Plain-text
source code files (e.g., ``.st`` files) belong in
``blark/tests/source``.

Feel free to contribute your own test cases and we’ll do our best to
ensure that blark parses them (and continues to parse them) without
issue.

modified, and in cases entirely rewritten to better support lark
